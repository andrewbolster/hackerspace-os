a basic software package for hackerspaces and similiar organizations.

based on django and python, it allows you to

 * manage and announce events (basic calendaring)
 * manage members and their payments
 * publish information about current projects
 * have a nice-looking website, which allows easy access (and edit functionality) to all that information 


TODO
-------------------
 * migrate to Django 1.3
 * cleanup
